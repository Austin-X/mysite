# Hi

This is just a repo where I test some Ruby on Rails stuff.

This app is deployed with a production env on [mailtrap123.club](https://mailtrap123.club/), [sandbox.mailtrap123.club](https://sandbox.mailtrap123.club/), [test1.test2.mailtrap123.club](https://test1.test2.mailtrap123.club/), and on [mysite-i6i2.onrender.com](https://mysite-i6i2.onrender.com/)

For now, the '/graphiql' path is disabled on all production envs as I have not paid for the database server yet.
